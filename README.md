# Palindrome Machine

This was a quick, fun project to see if I could make something that checks if a word or sentence is a palindrome. I used this to challenge myself to write clean logic and also mess around with some interface stuff.

It was satisfying to test a bunch of phrases and see the checker respond the way I expected. I used a tutorial for a bit but tried to do the logic and reasoning myself. 

Cool little tool that helped sharpen my condition-based thinking.
